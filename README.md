Firefox userChrome.css
i googled "cool words" for that title, by the way

# Install
[Find your Firefox profile folder](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data), create (if it's not already there) a "chrome" folder, and place userChrome.css in there. Quick restart, and you're done.

# Notes
Font used is [Lemon](https://github.com/phallus/fonts).

If you want the new tab page, place the userContent.css file in the chrome folder too.

Also, I originally had some css that was a kind of bright, all-in-one-line kinda deal from somebody on /r/FirefoxCSS, so shoutout to that guy for doing like half the work. I just moved some stuff and changed the colours.
